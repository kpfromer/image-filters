# Image Filters

## Description

This is a comp sci project where I create custom filters for images!

## Usage

First install all dependencies: `npm install`

Open up src/main.ts and change `imageUrl` for the path of the image to want to change. Change what filters you want in the `filters` array. Then run `npm start`!
